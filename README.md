# WayVR Protocol Specification & Client Implementation

This repository contains the IPC specification and client implementation for the WayVR Server protocol (which is used in wlx-overlay-s). The primary purpose is to enable communication between applications and the WayVR server, offering a range of API functions.

Currently, there is only a single client - [WayVR Dashboard](https://github.com/olekolek1000/wayvr-dashboard).
